# Pgo

This project aims to implement the RANSAC algorithm in Go using a concurrent pipeline to efficiently detect dominant planes in 3D point clouds. By experimenting with different configurations of the "Supporting point finder" component and measuring the execution time for each setup, the project seeks to find the optimal number of threads that provide the best performance. The results will be presented in a graph, and the final deliverables will include the Go source code and a comprehensive document detailing the experiments and findings.

The pipeline built is illustrated here:
